Description: Yolo authentication provider for Apache2
 The mod_authn_yolo module is an authentication provider for the Apache2. It
 accepts any combination of user and password.
 .
 Sometimes this is useful when testing or building a proof of concept, since
 there's no need to generate a htpasswd file etc. It can also be used to pass a
 user name to Apache in a Basic Authentication scenario where verification of
 the credentials is delegated to a reverse proxy in front of Apache.
